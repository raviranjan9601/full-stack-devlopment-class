    <!--
    <h1>–<h6>: The HTML Section Heading elements
    The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. 
    <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest. By default, 
    all heading elements create a block-level box in the layout, 
    starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in 
    their containing block. 
    -->
    
    <!-- 
    Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for 
    a document automatically.
    Do not use heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the CSS font-size property.
    Do not skip heading levels: always start from <h1>, followed by <h2> and so on.
    -->

    <h1>this is heading H1</h1>
    <h2>this is heading H2</h2>
    <h3>this is heading H3</h3>
    <h4>this is heading H4</h4>
    <h5>this is heading H5</h5>
    <h6>this is heading H6</h6>

    <!-- next is 'paragraph' tag -->

    <!-- 
    The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in 
    visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or 
    first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, 
    such as images or form fields.
     -->
    
    <!-- 
    Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another 
    block-level element is parsed before the closing </p> tag. See "Tag omission" below.
    -->

    <p>this is paragraph tag</p>
    
    <!-- next is 'BR' tag -->

    <!-- 
    The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). 
    It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
    -->

        <p>this is after useing br tag result</p>

    <!-- next is 'HR' tag -->


    <!-- 
    <hr>: The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element
    The <hr> HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: 
    for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
    -->
    <hr>
        <p>this is example of hr tag</p>
    <hr>

    <!-- next is entities in 'HTML'-->
    
    <!-- 
    Entity is a term from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), 
    which refers to a reference to information that can be defined once and used 
    throughout a document.
     -->
    
    <!-- 
    The term "HTML Entity" is used as a synonym for a character reference — a pattern of characters
    that can represent another character in the HTML. For example, &lt; is used to represent 
    the less-than symbol (<) in HTML content. 
    -->

    <!-- now we display H1 tage useing entities -->

    <!-- next is 'LIST' -->

    <!-- <li>: The List Item element -->
    
    <!-- 
    The <li> HTML element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (<ol>), an unordered list (<ul>), or a menu (<menu>). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.
